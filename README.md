# Compose Circle App :
**PROBLEM STATEMENT :**

Over 80% of Fortune 100 companies conduct hackathons to drive innovation. More than 50% of the hackathons are recurring events, indicating that they are a reliable tool for sustained innovation. According to the present competitive landscape, over a thousand hackathons ,competitive programming, and open source competitions are held internationally each year. 
However, it is quite difficult for students to be constantly aware of such events and to be properly prepared. Students who are not part of an appropriate community that can inform them about different contests, they miss out on chances to realise their inner potential. When students in a field are looking for appropriate teammates but are unable to get any help due to poor communication and lack of other students' enthusiasm, their ability to participate in a competition is limited by their contact radius.


**PROPOSED SOLUTION AND SCREENSHOT :**
 
The app's architecture consists of a home screen that requests the user's skill set and offers three options‚Äîhackathons, coding competitions, and open source‚Äîso that the user can select the platform on which he wishes to compete.

 Additionally, it prompts users to select a skill set from the list of options. The app's ability to help the user identify suitable teammates is its most intriguing feature. Users don't need to freak out when looking for teammates about a person's domain. A list will be filtered out by the programme, which will then present it to the user for selection. 

This app also gives users the opportunity to text with the students they want on their team and can get a chance to have proper conversation.
